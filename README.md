# Turn an old commercial brightfield live/real time neuron reconstruction setup into a slide scanner

## **!WARNING!**
**DON'T BLINDLY RUN THIS CODE WITHOUT EXACTLY UNDERSTANDING HOW EVERY PART OF IT WORKS! IT WILL TAKE OVER THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD TO INTERACT WITH THE COMMERCIAL PROGRAM GUI TO SEQUENTIALLY SCAN VOLUME BLOCKS LIKE A SLIDE SCANNER FOR YOUR AREA OF INTEREST VOLUME.**
**IF YOU MISSCONFIGURE A Z-level SCAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT YOU RISK CRASHING YOUR OBJECTIVE INTO YOUR SAMPLE. IF YOU MISSCONFIGURE THE SETUP FOR THIS PROGRAM CONTROLLING THE SOFTWARE THE SAME RISK EXISTS!**
**THE MICROSCOPE THIS WAS DEVELEOPED FOR WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE A SMALL TILE TO TILE DRIFT IN Z, WHICH THIS CODE CORRECTS FOR - YOUR MICROSCOPE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT OR NO DRIFT WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR. DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE WILL ALSO VARY IN THEIR GUI SETUP WHICH MAKES THIS CODE NOT GENERALLY APPLICABLE AND WOULD SURELY REQUIRE A FEW SELECTIVE MODIFICATIONS FOR SIMILAR SETUPS IN DIFFERENT LABS!**

**IDEALLY THIS CODE SHOULD ONLY SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR HOW YOU CAN INTERACT WITH A PROGRAM ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH ITS GUI IN AN AUTOMATED CODE BASED WAY**

**PLEASE BE SURE YOU COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING BEFORE TAKING CONTROL OF EXPENSIVE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT IN AN AUTOMATED WAY!**

**I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE CREATED BY THE USE OF THIS CODE OR DERIVATIVE CODE!**

## How it works
Once you click "ALL SET UP" the program will find gui elements which it needs to track or use on the screen. The tiles to be scanned can be entered in the text field bellow.
Once started the program will automatically start a z scan, save it, reset the commercial software setup, move to the next tile, and repeat the process for all tiles.
The created volumes can then be stitched together using Fiji.
